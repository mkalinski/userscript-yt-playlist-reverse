# userscript-yt-playlist-reverse
Userscript that reverses the order of youtube playlist traversal.

On YouTube videos with playlists, it offers menu options to play the list in
reverse order. It can also remember the playlist to always play it in reverse
order.

Unfortunately, the script currently doesn't work with the video in fullscreen,
because it depends on the playlist widget being displayed.
